# They are operators used to operate on numeric values. (Let's assume a=20 and b=10.)
# + Adds the values ​​on both sides. a + b = 30
# – Subtracts the value on the right from the left. a – b = 10
# * Multiplies the value on both sides. a * b = 200
# / Divides the left-hand value by the right-hand value. a / b = 2
# The % division result returns the remainder. (Modification operation) a / b = 0
# ** Performs the parent operation. a**b = 20 over 10
# // Rounds up. But if the value is negative, it rounds to the negative side. −9//2 = -5 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0
